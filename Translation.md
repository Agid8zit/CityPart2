# Translation Guidelines

This project uses per-language locale files (e.g., `Languages/English.lua`, `Languages/Japanese.lua`). Keys are shared across languages and each locale file declares its own `__default_dialect`.

## Rules
- Always include a `_default` string for every key. Other dialects are optional.
- Add dialect variants only when a language naturally needs them. Example: Japanese â€œTown Twitterâ€ lines include multiple dialect keys (`ja_kanto`, `ja_kansai`, `ja_tohoku`, `ja_kyushu`, `ja_hokkaido`, `ja_okinawa`) in addition to `_default`. Follow this pattern for any language that requires regional variants.
- If a language has no dialects, keep only `_default`.
- Keep keys identical across languages; do not rename or remove keys when adding translations.
- Leave placeholders (`"..."`) intact if you do not have a translation.
- Do not change `__default_dialect` unless you are intentionally switching the languageâ€™s fallback dialect.
- New languages: set `__default_dialect = "_default"` unless the language needs a different fallback, then add dialect entries as needed following the Japanese example.

## AI Fill Instructions (generic)
- Set `__default_dialect` to the primary dialect key for the target language (e.g., `ja_kanto`, `es_mx`, etc.).

### Non-TownTwitter (UI/standard keys)
- Keep `["_default"] = "<English text>"`.
- Add the language default: `["<primary_dialect>"] = "<translated text>"`.
- Add placeholder dialect slots (empty): `["DIALECT1"] = ""`, `["DIALECT2"] = ""`, `["DIALECT3"] = ""`.
- Do **not** add regional dialect keys for these entries.

Example:
```
["Some UI Text"] = {
    ["_default"] = "...",
    ["<primary_dialect>"] = "<translation>",
    ["DIALECT1"] = "",
    ["DIALECT2"] = "",
    ["DIALECT3"] = "",
},
```

### TownTwitter (dialected chatter)
- Keep `["_default"] = "<English text>"`.
- Provide all regional dialects appropriate for the language (e.g., `["ja_kanto"]`, `["ja_kansai"]`, `["ja_tohoku"]`, `["ja_kyushu"]`, `["ja_hokkaido"]`, `["ja_okinawa"]` for Japanese).
- Do **not** use `DIALECT1/2/3` here.

Example:
```
["I like the new coffee shop downtown."] = {
    ["_default"] = "...",
    ["ja_kanto"] = "新しいカフェ気に入った",
    ["ja_kansai"] = "新しいカフェええ感じやんか",
    ["ja_tohoku"] = "新しいカフェいいすぺ",
    ["ja_kyushu"] = "新しいカフェよかね",
    ["ja_hokkaido"] = "新しいカフェいい感じ",
    ["ja_okinawa"] = "新しく開ちたカフェ好ぎやびーん"
},
```

### Reusable prompt: locale autofill (any language)
Use this prompt for any target locale file. Replace placeholders in brackets before running:
```
You are updating [TARGET_FILE] to match every key in Languages/English.lua.
- Keep __default_dialect as it is (expected: "[PRIMARY_DIALECT]").
- Add any missing English keys.
- Dialects per key:
  * If the English entry has multiple dialects (Town Twitter style), use the full set: [_default, [PRIMARY_DIALECT], plus any regional dialects used in this language: [EXTRA_DIALECTS_LIST]]. 
  * Otherwise use only [_default, [PRIMARY_DIALECT]] (or just [_default] if the language has no dialects).
- _default must be either "..." or the English text for that key; if it isn’t "...", set it to the English text from English.lua.
- If [PRIMARY_DIALECT] is "...", replace it with the English text for that key. For any other dialects, only fill missing entries with "..."; do not overwrite existing translations.
- Preserve all non-_default existing translations; only fill placeholders and add missing dialect slots per the rules above.
Output the updated [TARGET_FILE] with all English keys present.
```

## Batch 1

Use this checklist to add missing English keys into `Languages/Japanese.lua`. Split by category:


### TownTwitter (dialected keys)
- **Crime & Police**
  - ["Every night it's sirens and shouting. Where are the police?"]
  - ["Break-ins everywhere. We need a police station closer than the next city over."]
  - ["Feels like crime's the only thing booming in this neighborhood."]
  - ["Every shop's installing bars on the windows. Maybe build a precinct instead?"]
  - ["Someone stole my bike again. At this point I should just rent it to them."]
  - ["Finally, a police precinct opened nearby. Streets already feel calmer."]
  - ["Just saw officers patrolling downtown. Feels safer than it's been in years."]
  - ["Crime dropped fast once the new Police Dept went up. Great work, city!"]
  - ["Courthouse finally opened! Justice might actually happen now!"]
  - ["Seeing blue lights used to mean trouble. Now it means peace of mind."]
  - ["Police doing their best, but there's only so many of them. Fund the department!"]
  - ["Response times are slow. Maybe the precinct needs more vehicles."]
  - ["Wouldn't mind a few more patrols in the alley behind my store."]
  - ["The courthouse backlog is wild! Cases from last year still waiting."]
  - ["If they had better funding, maybe the cops could stop using scooters."]
  - ["The new precinct's coffee is apparently better than the cafe's."]

- **Fire & Safety**
  - ["A single spark out here and the whole block's gone. Where are the firefighters?"]
  - ["My neighbor's grill caught fire and we had to use buckets. That can't be normal city life."]

  - ["Every time I smell smoke, I start packing. We need a fire dept."]

  - ["Firefighters saved the bakery! Free muffins for heroes."]

  - ["Fire Dept's underfunded. They're still driving 20-year-old trucks!"]
  - ["More firefighters, less fireworks! Give them proper funding!"]
  - ["Response times are slow lately. Maybe they need more stations."]
  - ["If the Fire Precinct had more funding, maybe insurance wouldn't be this high."]
  - ["Firefighters are doing their best, but the city's growing faster than their budget."]
  - ["Someone left their toast on again. I heard the sirens before the smoke alarm."]
  - ["If the Fire Station had a cafe, I'd stop by just to say thanks."]
  - ["Shoutout to the Fire Dept! They're faster than my internet."]

- **Health & Clinics**

- **Education**
  - ["Our kids deserve real classrooms, not overflow in hallways. Build more schools!"]
  - ["Buses are shipping students across town again. We need a local school now."]
